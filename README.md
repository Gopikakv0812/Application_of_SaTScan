# Application of scan statistics in implementation and modeling of hotspot of total cognization IPC crimes in India: An inferential perspective
Crime analysis is important in law enforcement and policy creation to prevent the crime.In India the criminal code in categorized into two:  Cognizable and Non-cognizable crimes. The cognizable cases are subdivided into IPC and SLL. This study attempts to identify places with significantly higher crime rates. The results of this study help the law enforcement organizations to take measures to prevent crime and maintain public safety in India. Scan Statistics is an inferential and multivariate analytical approach that is used in the field of spatial epidemiology to help distinguish between alarm clusters that are likely random events and those that require additional examination. Software used for the calculations is SaTScan Version 10.1.2. The research presented in this paper uses information from several Indian districts between 2014 and 2022. The study includes data gathering, geographic analysis and scan statistics analysis.
